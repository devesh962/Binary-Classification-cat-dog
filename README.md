The Classification is done using 8 layered Convolution Neural Network.

Proprocessing is done using OpenCV.

Augmentation is done using Image Generator.

Training vs Validation Accuracy and Loss graphs are plotted using Matplotlib.

Real life high quality images can also be tested.

Run the .py file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

The second .py file consist of same code but the dataset used is taken from Kaggle.
